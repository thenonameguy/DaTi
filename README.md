Dual analog Text input - A new way to enter text on the PS3/Xbox360
This was a one month high-school project we made in the fall of 2010.
We would like to share the source to the community so the project can improve.

Stuff that could be done:
* Lose C# all together and move to a real multiplatform solution
* Make it less CPU intensive
* Create a proper API for it
* Make a native application and use it as real text-input

Now it uses XNA 4.0, so it's heavily .NET dependent.
For now we only support the PS3 controller through MotionInJoy.
